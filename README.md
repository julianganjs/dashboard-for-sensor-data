# Dashboard for Sensor Data
This repository contains the source code for a web dashboard that displays sensor data. This dashboard is one of the projects that was assigned to me during my internship at Inari Technology Sdn Bhd. The sensor data displayed includes oven temperatures, freezer temperatures, environmental temperature and humidity, electrostatic discharge and HAST chamber conditions.
